#### individually addressable LEDS in a specific shape to help people locate our home or campsite.

The current version uses the addressable LEDS strips from Radio Shack.  I was able to purchase 7 or 8 meters of them when they were closing stores along with a bunch of other stuff.

Thks will be the prototype if friends want one for their own use.
